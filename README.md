# UnifiedLC Framework Code


## Model Overview  
**UnifiedLC** is a framework designed for cultivated land decision-making, with generalizable applications to broader land decision tasks. It integrates spatial data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning to support informed land management decisions.  


## Code Structure and Functionality  
### 1. Preprocessing Scripts  
- **step1_preprocess_csv_to_pkl.py**  
  First-stage preprocessing: Parses geohash codes of land data into definite latitude-longitude coordinates, then stores the processed data as pickle (`.pkl`) files.  

- **step2_preprocess_pkl_to_tensor.py**  
  Second-stage preprocessing: Converts data into tensors suitable for direct model input. Operations include spatial information aggregation, regional data partitioning, categorical attribute encoding, and numerical attribute standardization.  


### 2. Model and Training Tools  
- **tool_model.py**  
  Contains PyTorch model class definitions required for model execution, defining network architectures and forward propagation logic.  

- **tool_test_and_draw.py**  
  Includes functions for testing model performance, supporting evaluation metrics calculation and result visualization.  

- **tool_train.py**  
  Contains training functions with implemented enhancement strategies: variable learning rates, boundary contrastive learning, and QRAS ( Quad Rotation Augmentation Strategy).  


### 3. Main Execution Script  
- **main.py**  
  The primary entry point of the program, integrating scripts for model training and testing.  


### 4. Data Examples  
Three provided `.pt` files contain preprocessed data samples (after step1 and step2) that can be directly input into the model, demonstrating the data format and structure expected by the model.  


## Model Applications  
- Core application: Cultivated land decision-making (e.g., land use planning, soil protection strategies).  
- Generalizable to: Various land-related decision tasks, including urban land development, ecological conservation, and agricultural resource management.  

## Technical Features

- Spatial data processing pipeline for geohash and coordinate conversion.  
- End-to-end workflow from raw data to model inference.  
- Enhanced training strategies for improved generalization and accuracy.  
- Modular code structure for easy extension and customization.  


## Runtime Environment  
- **PyTorch**: 1.8.1  
- **Python**: 3.8
